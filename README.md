# **Forklift Design with Simscape**

This example models a forklift with three-stage mast. You can use this model 
to perform stability analyses by sweeping design parameters and test conditions. 
The mechanical model of the lift was created in CAD software and imported 
into Simscape Multibody. 

* **CAD geometry** is imported to accurately represent masses, 
inertias, and joint locations.
* **Mechanical effects** are incorporated into the design, including ground 
contact and cables in the lift mast
* **Stability analyses** are performed by sweeping design parameters in a 
range of test test scenarios
* **Actuator requirements** are refined using dynamic simulation with 
abstract actuator models
* **Test configurations** are automated using a MATLAB&reg; App
