%% Forklift Stability Model
% 
% 
% This example models a forklift with three-stage mast. You can use this model 
% to perform stability analyses by sweeping design parameters and test conditions. 
% The mechanical model of the lift was created in CAD software and imported 
% into Simscape Multibody. 
% 
% * *CAD geometry* is imported to ensure accurate representation of masses, 
% inertias, and joint locations.
% * *Mechanical effects* are incorporated into the design, including ground 
% contact and cables in the lift mast
% * *Stability analyses* are performed by sweeping design parameters in a 
% range of test test scenarios
% * *Actuator requirements* are refined using dynamic simulation with 
% abstract actuator models
% * *MATLAB Apps* enables rapid test configuration

%% Simulation Results from Simscape Logging, Step Steer Sweep
%%
% The heatmap below shows the relative stability of the forklift under
% varying test conditions during a step steer. 
% 
% * The value in the heat map is the minimum wheel normal force at the end
% of the test. Each individual heat map *varies the amount of load and side
% shift position* of the forks.
% * From left to right, each individual heat map shows the results with
% *increasing forward mast tilt* 
% * From bottom to top, each individual heamp shows the results with
% *increasing mast height* 
%
% The results show the worst case condition occurs at maximum forward tilt,
% maximum mast height.
